      <description>Different box this time, your target is now 10.128.0.4&amp;ndash;straight to root. Remember that there may be non-vulnerable services on the machine. Recon is the #1 focus.
Once you have access to the fourth machine in the range you need to listen on port tcp/5000, you can do this with nc, for example. The flag will be sent at a specific time. Retain control of the box to get all the flags.</description>

      <description>Can you really call it a &amp;ldquo;main&amp;quot;frame if I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it before now? Author: Research Innovations, Inc. (RII)
