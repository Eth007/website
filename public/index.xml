      <description>A few weeks ago, I played PicoCTF 2024 with a few friends. We were the first team to solve all the challenges, getting us first place on the high school scoreboard and first place overall. high frequency troubles by pepsipu was the least-solved challenge in the competition, with 31 solves at the end of the competition. I worked on this challenge with my teammate stuckin414141, and we were able to solve it with a pretty cool (although slightly unintended) solution.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Ethan, a current student at Stanford University.
I play CTFs with various teams (including idek and .;,;.) and compete in the International Cybersecurity Championship on the United States team.
Also, I am the founder of ImaginaryCTF, a community that produces daily CTF challenges for the community to learn and practice.
On this blog, I post occasional writeups of CTF challenges, as well as other topics (sometimes). Hope you enjoy your time here!</description>

      <description>So it&amp;rsquo;s consistent right? Hint: http://blog.redrocket.club/2020/12/23/HXPCTF-Still_Printf/ Connect with nc litctf.org 31779
 Last weekend, I played LIT CTF 2023 with a few friends. We solved 46/53 of the challenges, and ended up in first place overall (and first place in the high school division). I mainly focused on the binary exploitation challenges (and solved all seven of them!), but I also took a look at the pyjail challenges (which were pretty cool!</description>

      <description>Different box this time, your target is now 10.128.0.4&amp;ndash;straight to root. Remember that there may be non-vulnerable services on the machine. Recon is the #1 focus.
Once you have access to the fourth machine in the range you need to listen on port tcp/5000, you can do this with nc, for example. The flag will be sent at a specific time. Retain control of the box to get all the flags.</description>

 tl; dr Leak stack using leaks in random number generation, use format string to write to the return address and ret2libc.
solving Well, we got a binary, a libc, and a netcat connection. Upon running the binary, we see that it lets us &amp;ldquo;generate&amp;rdquo; 6 random numbers, and then asks for our name.</description>
