Hi! I'm Ethan, a current student at Stanford University.

I play CTFs with various teams (including [idek](https://idek.team) and [.;,;.](https://ctf.gg)) and compete in the International Cybersecurity Championship on the United States team.

Also, I am the founder of [ImaginaryCTF](https://imaginaryctf.org), a community that produces daily CTF challenges for the community to learn and practice.

On this blog, I post occasional writeups of CTF challenges, as well as other topics (sometimes). Hope you enjoy your time here!
